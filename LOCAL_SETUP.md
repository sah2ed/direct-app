# Create Docker Compose Env for Running Direct App Local Deployment Guide

## Deployment

```sh
git clone https://github.com/direct-app/direct-app.git
cd direct-app
git checkout base_docker_image_for_direct_app_local_setup
cp token.properties.docker-local token.properties
cp topcoder_global.properties.docker-local topcoder_global.properties
docker-compose up
```

Then configure the following entry in your hosts file of your computer (NOT the docker container):

192.168.99.100 cockpit.cloud.topcoder.com

Where 192.168.99.100 is the ip address of my docker machine (launched via docker toolbox for windows or mac). If you are using linux, you can simply use 127.0.0.1 here.

Wait until the jboss server is ready, and then open the following link in your browser https://cockpit.cloud.topcoder.com/direct, login with heffan/password. Note that the browser will warn you about the security certificate (as it's generated by me), just ignore and proceed.
